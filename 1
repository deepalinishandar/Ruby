Overview: Ruby is a high-level, dynamic programming language known for its simplicity and productivity. It was designed and developed by Yukihiro Matsumoto ("Matz") in the mid-1990s. Ruby emphasizes simplicity and productivity, with an elegant syntax that is easy to read and write.

Key Features:

Object-Oriented: Everything in Ruby is an object, including numbers, strings, and even classes and methods. Ruby supports object-oriented programming principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
Dynamic Typing: Ruby is dynamically typed, meaning that variable types are determined at runtime rather than compile time. This allows for flexibility but also requires careful attention to variable types.
Blocks and Procs: Ruby supports blocks of code that can be passed to methods, allowing for powerful and expressive programming constructs. Procs are anonymous functions that can be assigned to variables and passed around as objects.
Mixins: Ruby supports mixins, which allow modules to be included in classes to add functionality without inheritance. This promotes code reuse and modular design.
Meta-programming: Ruby has powerful meta-programming capabilities, allowing developers to dynamically define classes and methods at runtime, modify existing classes, and introspect objects.
Gems: RubyGems is a package manager for Ruby libraries and applications. There is a vast ecosystem of gems available for various purposes, ranging from web development frameworks to utility libraries.
Applications: Ruby is commonly used for a variety of purposes, including:

Web development: Ruby on Rails is a popular web application framework built with Ruby.
Scripting: Ruby's concise syntax and powerful string manipulation capabilities make it well-suited for writing scripts and automation tasks.
Prototyping: Ruby's expressive syntax and rapid development capabilities make it ideal for quickly prototyping ideas and concepts.
DevOps: Ruby is used in tools like Puppet and Chef for automating infrastructure management and deployment tasks.
Development Tools: Popular tools for Ruby development include:

Text editors and IDEs: Visual Studio Code, Sublime Text, Atom, RubyMine.
Ruby Version Manager (RVM) and rbenv: Tools for managing Ruby versions and gemsets.
Bundler: A tool for managing project dependencies and installing gems.
RSpec and Minitest: Testing frameworks for behavior-driven development (BDD) and unit testing in Ruby.
